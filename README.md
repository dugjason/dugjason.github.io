[JasonDugdale.com](http://jasondugdale.com) is built on [@mdo's](https://twitter.com/mdo) [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole).

Poole is the butler for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It's designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example templates, pages, posts, and styles.
